Preamble

There is something wrong...

Chapter II
Introduction
As a developer, you might have to work on software that will be used by hundreds of
people.
You have learned to develop more or less complex programs without taking security
into account.
With this project, you will quickly realize it’s rather easy to exploit issues that can
be very easily avoided.
Once you’re through with this project, you will have a clearer understanding of the
RAM. And this will really help you design a bugless program!

Chapter III
Objectives
This project aims to further your knowledge in the world of elf-like binary exploitation
in i386 system.
The more or less complex methods you will use will give you a new perspective on IT
in general, but mostly raise your awareness on issues coming from programming common
malpractice.
You will be challenged during this project. You have to overcome these challenges
by yourself. The way you’ll be dealing with these challenges must be yours and YOURS
ONLY. The point is to help you develop some logic and acquire reflexes that will help
you all along your career. Before asking for help, ask yourself if you have factored all the
possibilities in.

Chapter IV
General instructions
• This project will only be evaluated by humans.
• You may have to prove your results during the evaluation. Be ready!
• To make this project, you will have to use a VM(64 bits). Once you have started
your machine with the ISO provided with this subject, if your configuration is right,
you will get a simple prompt with an IP:

____
____ _
__
/ __ \_ _____ _____/ __ \(_)___/ /__
/ / / / | / / _ \/ ___/ /_/ / / __ / _ \
/ /_/ /| |/ / __/ / / _, _/ / /_/ / __/
\____/ |___/\___/_/ /_/ |_/_/\__,_/\___/
Good luck & Have fun
To start, ssh with level00/level00 on 192.168.1.3:4242
level00@192.168.1.3's password: _

If the IP address is not visible, you will get it with the command
ifconfig once you’re connected.

• Then, you will be able to connect using the following couple of login:password:
level00:level00.
You really should use the SSH connection available on port 4242:
$> ssh level00@192.168.1.13 -p 4242

• Once logged-in, you will have to find a way to read the ".pass" file with the "next
level level0X" (X = next level number) account.
• This ".pass" file is located at the home root of each (level00 excluded) user.

• Of course, once you’ve reached level09 you will have to go towards the end user.

• Here is a session example:
level0@OverRide:~$ ./level00 $(exploit)
$ cat /home/users/level01/.pass
?????????????????????
$ exit
level0@OverRide:~$ su level01
Password:
level01@OverRide:~$ _

• Nothing is left to chance. If there is a problem, start wondering if your code is not
the cause.
• Using an automation tool is cheating. Cheating gets you a -42.
• Of course, in case of a true bug, run to the educational team!
• You can post your questions on the forum, Jabber, IRC, Slack...

Chapter V
Mandatory part
• Your repo must include anything that helped you solve each validated test.
• Your repository will look like this:

$> ls -al

drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4096 Dec 3 XX:XX level01

$> _

• You will keep everything you need to prove your results during the evaluation in
the Resource folder. The flag file may be empty, but you may have to explain why.
• The source file must only include the exploited binary in a form any developer could
understand. You’re free to choose your language.
• The walkthrough file will include the different steps of the of the test solution.

WARNING: You must be able to clearly and precisely explain anything
that is included in the folder. The folder mustn’t include ANY
binary.

• If you need to use a specific file that’s included on the project’s ISO, you must download it during the evaluation. You must put it in your repo under no circumstances.
• If you plan to use a specific external software, you must set up a specific environment (VM, docker, Vagrant).
• You’re invited to create scripts that will make you stall, but you will have to explain
them during the evaluation.
• For the mandatory part, you must complete the following list of levels:
◦ level00.
◦ level01.
◦ level02.
◦ level03.
◦ level04.
◦ level05.
◦ level06.
◦ level07.
◦ level08.
• During the evaluation, each member of the group must be able to justify each challenge solved:

Hey, smarty (or not so smarty) pants! You cannot bruteforce the ssh
flags. This would be useless anyway, since you will have to justify
your solution during the evaluation.

Bonus part
For the bonus part, you can complete the following this last level:
• level09

The last user is "end". Becoming "root" is not a bonus.
considered to be cheating.

This is

The bonus part will only be assessed if the mandatory part is
PERFECT. Perfect means the mandatory part has been integrally done
and works without malfunctioning. If you have not passed ALL the
mandatory requirements, your bonus part will not be evaluated at all.

Chapter VII
Submission and peer-evaluation
Turn in your assignment in your Git repository as usual. Only the work inside your repository will be evaluated during the defense. Don’t hesitate to double check the names of
your folders and files to ensure they are correct.
